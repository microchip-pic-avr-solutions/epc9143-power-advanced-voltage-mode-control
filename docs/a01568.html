1) Microchip SMPS Firmware Framework Architecture Overview</h1>
<p>This introduction covers common aspects of the firmware architecture and provides guidance on specific firmware module documentation included in this document.</p>
<p><span id="sfw_1a"> </span> </p><h3>a) Overall Process Alignment</h3>
<p>Establishing a digital control system for a switched-mode power supply using a programmable microcontroller requires some specific considerations. Foremost, it is vital to allow the switching signal generation and high-speed real-time control loop to run freely and uninterrupted while background activity of additional, less time critical functions such as communication and housekeeping also gets enough bandwidth to be executed within their required timing tolerances.</p>
<p>This is achieved by splitting up processes among different functional sections of the device such as independent peripheral modules, the CPU itself and the multi-priority level interrupt controller of the dsPIC33 Digital Signal Controller. Peripherals are function blocks such as the PWM generator logic, Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC), Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) or communication interfaces such as Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART), Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) or Controller Area Network (CAN), which all support some degree of independent operation from the CPU but may all depend on the same system clock. A second class of peripherals are truly independent such as operational amplifiers, analog comparators or glue logic cells, which can operate even if the CPU and system clock are turned off.</p>
<p>This arrangement of different function blocks with different degrees of independence allows the generation of highly deterministic, high resolution switching signals commutating the power supply switch node while running multiple other processes in parallel without having one influencing the other.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_1b"></span> </p><h3>b) Software Task Alignment</h3>
<p>The critical component is where CPU activity needs to get shared between different software-driven processes such as housekeeping background tasks, processing communication protocols and the software-based real-time feedback loop. As the CPU can only execute one instruction at the time, this process alignment is managed by the multi-priority level interrupt controller mentioned above.</p>
<p>Depending on the device generation, the CPU architecture of dsPIC33 provides between 8 and 16 priority levels on which code can be executed. Interrupt nesting allows higher priority processes to interrupt lower priority processes. While a higher priority process is executed, the lower priority process is stopped at the point when the interrupt occurred. Its execution continues seamlessly after the high priority process has been completed.</p>
<p>Priority level #0 is the lowest one and is continuously occupied by the main program, which is automatically started when the device comes out of reset. The highest priority level (#8 or #16) is reserved for so-called uninterruptible processes, such as fatal errors caused by a divide by zero, an address error, stack error or oscillator failure, which are the equivalent to a PC's blue screen error. These <em>fatal errors</em> will all lead to a CPU reset if not handled in software. All remaining priority levels can be selected by the user and used to arrange software processes to account for their individual importance, timing tolerance or required response time.</p>
<p>Depending on how many priority levels are staggered for simultaneous execution, the respective execution time of a process will be more deterministic the higher its priority level, resp. less deterministic the lower its priority level is.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<h4>Example A: Single Interrupt</h4>
<p>The CPU is running executing the main loop of the program on priority level #0. This routine is interrupted by another process called on priority level #2. Hence, the level #0 process is suspended until the process on priority level #2 has been executed and the CPU returns to priority level #0.</p>
<center> <img src="images/irq_p0-2.png" alt="Single Interrupt" width="500" class="inline"/> </center> <center><em>Example A: Single Interrupt Process Alignment</em></center><p>While the total execution time of the process on priority level #2 t(p2) in this example is deterministic, as it will be executed uninterrupted, the total execution time of the process on priority level #0 t(p0) will now be the sum of both processes t(p0) + t(p2). Hence, the priority level #2 process will behave more deterministic than the priority level #0 task.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>] </p><h4>Example B: Two Interrupts</h4>
<p>However, if a even higher priority level #6 process is called while the process on priority level #2 is still active, the priority level #2 process gets also interrupted and suspended until the execution of the priority level #6 process has been completed.</p>
<center> <img src="images/irq_p0-2-6.png" alt="Two Interrupt Priorities" width="580" class="inline"/> </center> <center><em>Example B: Two Interrupts Process Alignment</em></center><p>Now the execution time of priority level #6 process is deterministic while the execution time of the priority level #2 process includes the execution time spend to execute the priority level #6 process. The total execution time of the priority level #0 process is now the sum of t(p0), t(p2) and t(p6).</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<h4>Example C: Mixed Interrupt Priorities</h4>
<p>To make things even more complex, we now introduce a fourth, simultaneous process on interrupt level #5, which occurs while the higher interrupt priority level #6 is still active. As priority #6 is higher than level #5, the priority level #5 process will be pending until the higher priority level #6 process has been completed. However, instead of stepping back down to the suspended priority level #2 process, the newly occurred priority level #5 process is executed first before the priority level #2 process is continued. The main program will be resumed once all higher priority levels have been completed.</p>
<center> <img src="images/irq_p0-2-6-5.png" alt="Mixed Interrupt Priorities" width="640" class="inline"/> </center> <center><em>Example C: Mixed Interrupt Priorities Process Alignment</em></center><p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_1c"></span> </p><h3>c) Software Process Priority Guidelines</h3>
<p>As stated above, in a switched-mode power supply the real-time control loop always requires to have the highest priority in the system to ensure stable operation of the digital compensation filter including all potentially necessary real-time responses applied to the switching operation. In multi-loop control systems such as average current mode, multiple high-priority processes are usually triggered by the switching signal generator (i.e. PWM module) being distributed across a switching cycle to ensure uninterrupted, collision-free execution of each feedback loop.</p>
<p>The next lower level is commonly reserved for tasks, which are less time critical than the real-time control loops but only allow a limited amount of execution time jitter and require to be executed at a known, deterministic frequency. This is commonly true for the power supply state machine and fault monitor. This class of processes are called high-priority tasks.</p>
<p>The lowest levels are reserved for uncritical tasks or tasks not relying on deterministic execution such as communication protocol responses, self-diagnostic functions, human-machine interface (HMI) operations or housekeeping functions.</p>
<p>Each of these three basic levels may accept a certain amount of jitter in its execution period and or execution repetition frequency. Both properties may influence the reliability of a process and needs to be examined carefully to ensure the complete firmware remains stable, reliable and responsive. Slower tasks with comparatively long execution periods usually accept larger execution period jitter as well as are less reliant on a precise execution repetition frequency and therefore can be placed at lower priority levels. the more time critical a process, the shorter it execution time usually is, allowing to place it at higher priorities, frequently interrupting the lower priority tasks.</p>
<p>For example, processing a communication response includes multiple different steps such as receiving a certain number of data bytes, performing a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) validating, parsing command and data content, generating the response, handing the response back to the communication interface, monitoring the transmission of the response. Depending on the type of interface and transmission mechanism used, this process can take many milliseconds to complete and may occur every couple of seconds. Im comparison, a real-time control loop of a power supply may only take a couple of 100 nanoseconds to be executed at a repetition frequency of several 100 kHz. Hence, processing the communication protocol will potentially get interrupted thousands of times in one communication cycle.</p>
<p>Hence, aligning low and high priority processes requires to break up the longer, more tolerant tasks in smaller sub-processes, which can be called in defined sequences, the so-called states. These states are then managed and monitored by individual sequencers called state machines. The more processes need to run in parallel, the smaller the individual states of a state machine need to be to allow most effective interleaving of parallel processes.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
2) Buck Converter State Machine</h1>
<p>The state machine managing the interleaved synchronous buck converter ot the EPC9143 1/16th brick power module reference design is implemented as high priority task in the task execution scheme described above. This state machine is tuned for constant voltage regulation. Hence, it offers user-programmable soft-start support including power on-delay, ramp up slope and power good delay, which allows users to tune the startup behavior and include this module in a larger sequencing scheme. The state machine further supports hardware triggered events such as an external ENABLE pin and a POWER GOOD output. Both active pins can be configured in push-pull or open drain mode.</p>
<p>The startup configuration can be configured as shown in the following drawing:</p>
<center> <img src="images/soft-start.png" alt="Soft-Start Timing Profile" width="640" class="inline"/> </center> <center><em>Soft-Start Timing Profile</em></center><p>During execution, it goes through the following steps in chronological order:</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2a"></span> </p><h3>a) Initialization</h3>
<p>In this step the control loop parameters are reset to their defaults, PWM outputs are turned off but the PWM is still running, continuously triggering the ADC to keep sampling input and output voltage as well as board temperature.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2b"></span> </p><h3>b) Reset</h3>
<p>This is the 'fall-back' state from which the buck converter will be restarted once it has been started successfully and has been shut down due to a fault condition (e.g. input under/over voltage or over temperature condition)</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2c"></span> </p><h3>c) Standby</h3>
<p>After RESET, the state machine waits for all fault flags to be cleared and the enable and GO bits to be set.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2d"></span> </p><h3>d) Power-On Delay (POD)</h3>
<p>Once the buck converter has been cleared the state machine will execute the startup procedure starting with the Power On Delay. This is just a simple delay during which the converter will remain inactive but the fault handler will observe the values generated by the ADC for occurring fault conditions.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2e"></span> </p><h3>e) Launch Voltage Ramp</h3>
<p>After the Power-On delay has expired, input and output voltage will be measured. In case the converter output is pre-biased (voltage = non-zero), the power controller will be 'pre-charged' with an artificial control history and PWM output to softly ramp up the output voltage from its most recent level.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2f"></span> </p><h3>f) Voltage Ramp-Up</h3>
<p>Now the digital feedback loop and PWM are enabled and the closed loop system reference value is incremented with every execution of the state machine (100 µsec interval). The control loop has been adjusted to operate with a cross-over frequency of &gt;10 kHz matching the maximum perturbation frequency allowed to keep the control system stable. <br  />
</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2g"></span> </p><h3>g) Power Good Delay (PGD)</h3>
<p>After the reference voltage has been increased to the pre-defined nominal level, the state machine switches over into the Power Good Delay period. This is another, simple delay where the control loop is in steady state waiting for the delay period to expire.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2h"></span> </p><h3>h) Online</h3>
<p>After the Power Good Delay has expired, the converter drops into nominal operation. In this condition it continuously observes the reference value for changes. Should any other part of the firmware change the controller reference, the state machine will softly tune into the new level instead of hard-switching the reference.</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_2i"></span> </p><h3>i) Suspend/Error</h3>
<p>If the power controller is shut down and reset by external commands (e.g. fault handler detecting a fault condition or through user-interaction), the state machine is switching into the SUSPEND state, which disables the PWM outputs and control loop execution, clears the control histories and resets the state machine back to RESET</p>
<p>[<a href="#startDoc">back</a>]</p>
<p><span id="sfw_3"></span> </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
3) Fault Monitor</h1>
<p>The fault handler is an independent firmware task, based on a fault monitor library, which is used to define certain so-called Fault Objects. A 'Fault Object' represents a value of a special function register or global user variable, which will monitored and validated by the Fault Monitor Library. The Library supports different comparisons for validation, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater Than</li>
<li>Less Than</li>
<li>Equal</li>
<li>Not Equal</li>
<li>Within Range</li>
<li>Out Of Range</li>
</ul>
<p>Fault Monitor source values are either compared against a user-defined constant (static threshold), or another variable (dynamic threshold). THe Fault Monitor further supports two thresholds, one defining the Fault Trip Level and a second Fault REcovery Level. Depending on the type of comparison selected, the range between both thresholds is either interpreted as hysteresis or range. (see <b>Fault Handler Library</b> for details)</p>
<p>The fundamental mechanism of detecting fault conditions and creating trip and recovery responses is based on a simple, adjustable detection filter, which does not influence the monitored value but delays the response of the software. Depending on the type of value monitored, the firmware may need to react sooner or later while the fault detection sensitivity needs to be adjusted accordingly to prevent the power supply from unintended shut downs.</p>
<p>The delay filter counts successive threshold violations, comparing the most recent counter value against an absolute, user-defined maximum. When one sample of the monitored value does <em>not</em> violate the given threshold, the counter is reset and starts incrementing from zero at the next threshold detection. When the monitored value remains violating the given threshold until the counter reaches or exceeds the defined maximum counter value, the power supply shut down event is triggered, turning off PWM outputs and control loops and resetting the state machine, waiting for the fault condition to disappear.</p>
<center> <img src="images/fault_trip.png" alt="Fault Detection" width="540" class="inline"/> </center> <center><em>Fault Detection</em></center><p>Recovering from a fault condition uses the same mechanism, but provides its individual set of parameters. Thus, fault trip responses can be adjusted to be aggressive while recovery events can be further delayed to prevent the end-product from falling into an undesired, high frequency shut-down/restart cycle.</p>
<center> <img src="images/fault_recovery.png" alt="Fault Detection" width="540" class="inline"/> </center> <center><em>Fault Recovery</em></center><p>The most recent firmware version supports the following fault objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Under Voltage Lock Out (UVLO)</b> When the input voltage drops below the specified minimum voltage, the power supply is shut down, waiting for the input voltage to recover. If the power has been cut, the power supply will remain off until all capacitors are discharged and the microcontroller (MCU) shuts down. The PWM inputs of teh FET driver are pulled low until that point. The MCU drops out at voltages below 2.9V, which is below the UVLO level of teh FET driver. Hence, the gate drive signals remain pulled to off-state continuously without the chance to accidentally turn on.</li>
<li><b>Over Voltage Lock Out (UVLO)</b> When the input voltage exceeds the specified absolute maximum value, the power supply is shut down. waiting for the input voltage to drop back into the specified range. Auxiliary power supply, feedback voltage dividers and the power FETs support input voltages of up to 20V above the specified maximum to allow proper tracking of the input voltage even under fault conditions.</li>
<li><b>Over Current Protection (OCP)</b> The over current protection requires a very fast response in comparison to voltage monitors. Hence, two successive threshold violations are enough to trip an over current fault condition, shutting down the power supply. As an over current fault condition disappears instantly when the power supply has been shut down, the recovery delay needs to be significantly expended to result in a decent fault response behavior of the end-product.</li>
<li><b>Regulation Error (RegErr)</b> This fault object continuously monitors the deviation between output voltage and control reference. With a small deviation and a time delay, which allows normal voltage drops and overshoots during load transients, this fault object is the last line of defense. Any fault condition whcih cannot be detected by the other fault objects, such as internal short circuits, oscillating feedback loops or failing components, will inevitably result in larger deviations of the output voltage from the given reference and will lead to a protective shut down of the power supply.</li>
</ul>

4) Evaluation, Customization and Code Migration</h1>
<p>This firmware utilizes a so-called hardware abstraction layer, allowing users to quickly change fundamental system parameters, adopt pin-out and hardware changes and even migrating the firmware across different designs without having to modify the actual source code.</p>
<p>Any change to the firmware and fundamental operation of the reference design, including reprogramming of the nominal output voltage can be done by editing the hardware-specific values in the hardware description header file **'<a class="el" href="a00137_source.html">epc9143_r40_hwdescr.h</a>'** located in **'Project Manager =&gt; Header Files/Config'**</p>
<p>Converter settings in this file are defined as physical values such as Volt, Ampere, Ohm, etc. Each defined value is converted into binary numbers by so-called macros, at compile time. Thus, users do not have to convert values manually.</p>
<p>A detailed description of all available settings, their valid range and purpose can be found in chapter <b>Hardware Abstraction Layer</b> in this documentation.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>To program the converter to provide a nominal output voltage different from the 12 V DC default setting, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the project in MPLAB X® IDE</li>
<li>Navigate to 'Header Files/Config/epc9143_r40_hwdescr.h' using the Project Manager on the left side of the main window</li>
<li>Go to line #483 (see below)</li>
<li>Change the given settings as desired</li>
<li>Build the program</li>
<li>Remove power from the input of the EPC9531 test fixture</li>
<li>Connect a valid ICSP programming device (e.g. MPLAB ICD4, MPLAB PICkit4) to the PC and the EPC9531 test fixture (see <a href="https://epc-co.com/epc/documents/guides/EPC9531_qsg.pdf">EPC9531 Quick Start Guide</a> for details)</li>
<li>Program the device with the target device being powered by the debugger/programmer</li>
<li>Disconnect the ICSP programming device from the EPC9531 test fixture</li>
<li>Apply valid input voltage across the input terminals of EPC9531 and observe the output of the EPC9143 reference design</li>
</ul>
<p>The setting for the nominal output voltage is found in lines #484 through #486. </p><pre class="fragment">#define BUCK_VOUT_NOMINAL           (float)12.000  // Nominal output voltage
#define BUCK_VOUT_TOLERANCE_MAX     (float)0.500   // Output voltage tolerance [+/-]
#define BUCK_VOUT_TOLERANCE_MIN     (float)0.100   // Output voltage tolerance [+/-]
</pre><h4>Please note:</h4>
<p>The tolerance settings above include the transient response at a maximum load step. The value for maximum output voltage tolerance 'BUCK_VOUT_TOLERANCE_MAX' is observed by the fault handler. Should the output voltage reading divert from the most recent reference voltage value by more than the given range, the converter will be shut down and a REGULATION ERROR will be indicated. The power supply will automatically recover as soon as the fault condition has been cleared and the recover delay period specified by BUCK_REGERR_RECOVERY_DELAY in line #749 of the EPC9143 hardware description header file has expired.</p>

When the following define is set to <b>true</b>, the common main control loop is replaced by the proportional controller. </p><pre class="fragment">app_power_control.c, line 33:   #define PLANT_MEASUREMENT   false
</pre><h5>PLEASE NOTE:</h5>
<p>PROPORTIONAL CONTROLLERS ARE BY DEFAULT UNSTABLE AND NOT SUITED TO REGULATE THE OUTPUT OF A POWER SUPPLY UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS. DURING A PLANT MEASUREMENT IT IS MANDATORY THAT INPUT VOLTAGE AND LOAD REMAIN STABLE AND DO NOT CHANGE.</p>
