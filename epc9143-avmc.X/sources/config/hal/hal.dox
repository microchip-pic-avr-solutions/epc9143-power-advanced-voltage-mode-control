@defgroup hardware-id-macro Hardware Version ID
@ingroup abstraction-layer
@brief Global identified to the hardware version used

@details
 The main purpose or a hardware abstraction layer is to provide one central point 
 in complex firmware architectures where hardware dependencies can be specified, 
 signal scalings can be defined and specific chip resources can be assigned to support/
 connect generic software functions to the hardware. 

 This central definitions allow fast modifications and optimizations but also support 
 fast code migration between different hardware platforms. Thus, fast adaptation of new 
 hardware can be achieved by modifying this set of centralized definitions. 

 By including a hardware abstraction header file in a project results in an automated 
 adaptation of all parameters available. To ensure no conflicts occur, each hardware 
 abstraction layer header file needs a unique identifier. This unique identifier is provided
 by the so-called Hardware Version ID.

@brief Declaration of fundamental PWM parameters
 
@details
 This section defines fundamental PWM settings required for the interleaved buck converter
 of the EPC9143 300W 16th brick power module reference design. This design requires two PWM
 generators, generating complementary, fixed frequency PWM waveforms operated 180Â° out of phase
 to commutate the switching nodes of both phases of the interleaved synchronous buck converter
 topology.
 
 These settings are determined by the hardware pinout and the target device used. Users can modify 
 high level parameters such as PWM switching frequency and dead times by using physical quantities. 
 Pre-compiler macros are used to automatically convert physical values into binary (integer) numbers
 at compile time to be written to variables and/or Special Function Registers (SFR) at runtime.
 
 This section is also used to assign peripheral instances to the device pins used as PWM generator 
 outputs. This includes timing parameter registers, interrupt sources, ADC trigger signals and 
 output pin control registers.

 In this section generic labels are assigned to dedicated device pins and peripheral 
 registers of PWM generators used to commutate the power supply plant switching node. 
 These settings allow the fast re-assignments of feedback signals in case of hardware 
 changes and make the code more readable.
