## Buck Converter Device Driver
### State machine for voltage and average current mode controlled single- and multiphase synchronous buck converter

**Description**
This group of code files are providing a generic state machine driving one buck converter instance in voltage or average current mode control.
The code includes the state machine, which allow to have/run multiple instances in parallel in a single project. 
Hence, multiple, independent buck converters can be added and controlled wihtout having to add individual control code. 

These code files should be included on 'device' level in SMPS Firmware Framework projects of Grade 0, 1 and 2.
The Buck Converter Controller Object needs to be initialized on 'task/app' level while the effective control loop code is generated by DCLD on 'driver' level.

####Supported variants:
* Single Phase Converter
* Multiphase Converter 
* Synchronous Buck Converter
* Asynchronous Buck Converter
